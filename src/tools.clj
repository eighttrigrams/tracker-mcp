    "Tracker is a superhuman memory system which here represent's my (Daniel, the User) memory.
     Instead of sending long search strings to this MCP, often one finds things by looking
     them up in the right category, which in Tracker is called \"Context\".

     Everything is an \"Item\" in Tracker. It is the basic unit. 
     And the \"Contexts\" are a subset of all the \"Items\" stored in Tracker.
     \"Contexts\" may denote subjects, topics, collections, categories, or simply items that group a lot of other items.

     Searches in Tracker are done, instead of sending long search strings, rather by finding items in the right contexts.
     This is why every search in Tracker should start with breaking down the thing we search into their likely categories (contexts)
     they might be found in, and then find related items.

     \"Contexts\" tend to have shorter titles, non context \"Items\" tend to have longer, 
     more specific titles (who's titles are unlikely to be matched by any particular search terms \"q\")."

                     and break search terms down.</IMPORTANT>
                     
                     Query string. Obviously, when trying to find anything, we need to narrow down the search result, ideally such that 
                     the thing we search for is the top search result. Note that normally we limit the results to 10, so you might not even see any more."}}

     <SEARCH STRATEGY>
     <DO>
     Before calling this tool, especially when you are about to call it with longer search terms, consider calling the \"get_contexts\" tool first.
     </DO>

     <DO>
     Search in Tracker system usually involve multiple tool calls to various tools
     to finally arrive at good search results. The first step in such a search-chain is
     always via get_items, and specifically the first step is always to find a couple
     of suitable contexts via get_contexts.

     In general search results in tracker yield items (which may or may not be considered context items, see property is_context),
     but without description. So at any point, if you have an item in tracker,
     to fetch its description to get more insight to inform further searches, 
     use the get_item tool, to get the item with its description.

     When searching for specific persons you know the name of, try using the get_people tool.
     </DO>
     <DONT>
     Instead of for example searching for \"World War II videos\", in Tracker,
     always search for \"World War II\" and \"Videos\" contexts. Longer chains
     of words in searches are indicators that the purpose of Tracker as an intersection
     search based search system is defeated, or its potential not fully used during search.
     
     Don't use this reflexively to search for people you know names of. For that, rather use the get_people tool.
     </DONT>
     </SEARCH STRATEGY>

     Result lists are in order of most recently touched first (where touched can mean a 
     modification or just having looked at it). This is designed such on purpose, because
     Tracker represeents my personal memory and more recently touched items are literally
     \"on the top of my mind\". Note that this also means that items first listed 
     should be understood to have a higher weight/relevance.

     Sometimes searches for specific search terms (via the q argument) and without
     the only_contexts argument make sense, but instead of lets say searching 
     Quotes for the topic of World War II, in Tracker the recommended strategy is
     searching for a Quotes context and then a World War II context,
     and then continuing with intersection searches with the get_related_items tool.
     
     One other important thing, while context items are meant to act as containers
     and entry point for searches, EVERY item has the same property that you
     can get its description via get_item, and find items related to it via
     get_related_items."

                  Whenever you can, **prefer** intersection search using the secondary_contexts_items_ids
                  argument, thereby narrowing down results with multiple context ids, over using
                  all to specific search strings provided under the q parameter.
                  
                  If you can get away with it, then use multiple ids in secondary_contexts_items_ids
                  to make the search even narrower defined. 
                  
                  When doing that, make the broader categories/contexts ids be provided
                  in secondary_contexts_items_ids and the less specific id provided as
                  selected-context-item-id. For example, Quotes on the Second World War ->
                  Quotes is the broader category, so the quotes id is provided via
                  secondary_contexts_items_ids and the Second World War id is provided via
                  selected_context_item_id.

                                                 Obviously, when trying to find anything, we need to narrow down the search result, ideally such that

                                          However, when a selected_context is given, you might want to give an empty query string to see all items available and related to a given context.
